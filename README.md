# AI-ML-Labs
CS 337 + 335 : Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Labs

The topics covered in each lab are as follows:
Lab1 : Multi-class perceptron classifier (1v1 and 1vr methods) on data set of shape images
Lab2 : Feed-forward NNs and CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
Lab3 : Ensemble Learning algorithms, Bagging and Boosting (AdaBoost)
Lab4 : Clustering, k-means and k-medians clustering, their variants and their application on image compression
Lab5 : Regularization (Ridge, Lasso regression) and Validation (k-fold cross validation)
Lab6 : MDP (Markov Decision Process) planning using value iteration and its application in maze solvers
Lab7 : Solving sudoku puzzle using various search algorithms like A*-search
Lab8 : Finding approximate solutions of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various techniques like hill-climbing

Note: CIFAR-10 dataset has been removed from Lab2 due to its 200MB size
